            <h1>Custom Functions in Google Sheets</h1>
            <p>Google Sheets offers hundreds of built-in functions like AVERAGE, SUM, and VLOOKUP. When these aren’t enough for your needs, you can use Google Apps Script to write custom functions — say, to convert meters to miles or fetch live content from the Internet — then use them in Google Sheets just like a built-in function.</p>

            <h2>Getting started</h2>
            <p>Custom functions are created using standard JavaScript</p>
            <p>Here's a simple custom function, named DOUBLE, which multiplies an input value by 2:</p>

            <h5>Using a custom function</h5>
            <p>Once you've written a custom function or installed one from the Google Workspace Marketplace, it's as easy to use as a built-in function:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click the cell where you want to use the function.</li>
                <li>Type an equals sign (=) followed by the function name and any input value — for example, =DOUBLE(A1) — and press Enter.</li>
                <li>The cell will momentarily display Loading..., then return the result.</li>

            </ol>
            <h5>Guidelines for custom functions</h5>
            <p>Before writing your own custom function, there are a few guidelines to know.</p>
            <h6>Naming</h6>
            <ul>
                <li>The name of a custom function must be distinct from the names of built-in functions like SUM().</li>

                <li>The name of a custom function cannot end with an underscore (_), which denotes a private function in Apps Script.</li>
                <li>The name of a custom function must be declared with the syntax function myFunction(), not var myFunction = new Function().</li>
                <li>Capitalization does not matter, although the names of spreadsheet functions are traditionally uppercase.</li>

            </ul>
            <h6>Arguments</h6>
          <p>Like a built-in function, a custom function can take arguments as <strong>input values: </strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you call your function with a reference to a single cell as an argument (like =DOUBLE(A1)), the argument will be the value of the cell.</li>
            <li>If you call your function with a reference to a range of cells as an argument (like =DOUBLE(A1:B10)), the argument will be a two-dimensional array of the cells' values. For example, in the screenshot below, the arguments in =DOUBLE(A1:B2) are interpreted by Apps Script as double([[1,3],[2,4]]). Note that the sample code for DOUBLE from above would need to be modified to accept an array as input.</li>
            <li>Custom function arguments must be deterministic. That is, built-in spreadsheet functions that return a different result each time they calculate — such as NOW() or RAND() — are not allowed as arguments to a custom function. If a custom function tries to return a value based on one of these volatile built-in functions, it will display Loading... indefinitely.</li>

         </ul>
         <h6>Return values</h6>
         <p>Every custom function must return a value to display, such that:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>If a custom function returns a value, the value displays in the cell the function was called from.</li>
            <li>If a custom function returns a two-dimensional array of values, the values overflow into adjacent cells as long as those cells are empty. If this would cause the array to overwrite existing cell contents, the custom function will throw an error instead. For an example, see the section on optimizing custom functions.</li>
            <li>A custom function cannot affect cells other than those it returns a value to. In other words, a custom function cannot edit arbitrary cells, only the cells it is called from and their adjacent cells. To edit arbitrary cells, use a custom menu to run a function instead.</li>
            <li>A custom function call must return within 30 seconds. If it does not, the cell will display an error: Internal error executing the custom function.</li>
         </ul>
         <h6>Data types</h6>
         <p>Google Sheets stores data in different formats depending on the nature of the data. When these values are used in custom functions, Apps Script treats them as the appropriate data type in JavaScript. These are the most common areas of confusion:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Times and dates in Sheets become Date objects in Apps Script. If the spreadsheet and the script use different time zones (a rare problem), the custom function will need to compensate.</li>
            <li>Duration values in Sheets also become Date objects, but working with them can be complicated.</li>
            <li>Percentage values in Sheets become decimal numbers in Apps Script. For example, a cell with a value of 10% becomes 0.1 in Apps Script.</li>

         </ul>
         <h6>Autocomplete</h6>
         <p>Google Sheets supports autocomplete for custom functions much like for built-in functions. As you type a function name in a cell, you will see a list of built-in and custom functions that matches what you enter.</p>
         <p>Custom functions will appear in this list if their script includes a JsDoc @customfunction tag, as in the DOUBLE() example below.</p>

    <h4>Optimization</h4>
    <p>Each time a custom function is used in a spreadsheet, Google Sheets makes a separate call to the Apps Script server. If your spreadsheet contains dozens (or hundreds, or thousands!) of custom function calls, this process can be quite slow.</p>
    <p>Consequently, if you plan to use a custom function multiple times on a large range of data, consider modifying the function so that it accepts a range as input in the form of a two-dimensional array, then returns a two-dimensional array that can overflow into the appropriate cells.</p>
    <p>For example, the DOUBLE() function shown above can be rewritten to accept a single cell or range of cells as follows:</p>

    <div class="codexample">
        <code>
            /**
                * Multiplies the input value by 2. <br>
                *
                * @param {number|Array<Array<number>>} input The value or range of cells <br>
                *     to multiply. <br>
                * @return The input multiplied by 2. <br>
                * @customfunction <br>
                */ <br>
                function DOUBLE(input) { <br>
                return Array.isArray(input) ? <br>
                    input.map(row => row.map(cell => cell * 2)) : <br>
                    input * 2; <br>
                } <br>

        </code>
    </div>
    <p>The above approach uses the <b>map</b> method of JavaScript's Array object to recursively call DOUBLE on every value in the two-dimensional array of cells. It returns a two-dimensional array that contains the results. This way, you can call DOUBLE just once but have it calculate for a large number of cells at once, as shown in the screenshot below. (You could accomplish the same thing with nested if statements instead of the map call.)</p>
