        <h2>CSS Box Sizing</h2>

       <p> The CSS box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.
        Without the CSS box-sizing Property</p>
        
        <p>By default, the width and height of an element is calculated like this: </p>
        
        width + padding + border = actual width of an element
        height + padding + border = actual height of an element
        
        <p>This means: When you set the width/height of an element, the element often appears bigger than you have set (because the element's border and padding are added to the element's specified width/height).</p>
        
        The following illustration shows two div elements with the same specified width and height:
    </div>
    <div class="div1">
        <p>This box in boxing sizing property</p>
    </div>

    <div class="div2">
        <p>This one without box sizing property</p>
    </div>
    <p>The two div elements above end up with different sizes in the result (because div2 has a padding specified):</p>
    <p>The box-sizing property solves this problem.</p>
    <h2>With the CSS box-sizing Property</h2>
    <p>The box-sizing property allows us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height</p>
    <p>If you set box-sizing: border-box; on an element, padding and border are included in the width and height:</p>

    <div class="box-sizing">
        <p>THis one box sizing </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box-sizing2">
       <p>This also but diffrent padding this has padding 50px</p>
    </div>
<p>Since the result of using the box-sizing: border-box; is so much better, many developers want all elements on their pages to work this way.</p>
<p>The code below ensures that all elements are sized in this more intuitive way. Many browsers already use box-sizing: border-box; for many form elements (but not all - which is why inputs and text areas look different at width: 100%;). </p>
<p>Applying this to all elements is safe and wise:</p>

<code class="box-sizing">
    * {
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }
